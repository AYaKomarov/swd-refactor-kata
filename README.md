# swd-refactor-kata
In this 3 katas, your goal is to write covering unit tests and to refactor code to make it simple, readable, and more robust. 

Bad smells to avoid:
* Method bodies too long
* Methods have big nesting (if, try/catch, ...)
* Duplicate code blocks
* Methods with too many arguments
* Uncliear exception handling
* JDK utils underused
